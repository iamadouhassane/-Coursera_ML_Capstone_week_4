A quick and simple way to show you that this analysis is limited is to take for example a Neighborhood where we have a lot of restaurants so high frequency, interesting and attractive but if all the restaurants are badly rated then we risk losing a lot of money . Also a Neighborhood can have few restaurants but be far profitable because the restaurants are highly rated and they receive customers of a certain social class because they sell luxury meals.\n",
